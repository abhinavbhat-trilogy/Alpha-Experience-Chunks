Okay so Fernando who has access to my GitHub project has pushed a change. However the auto-deploy on Vercel is failing Fernando said he would open the PI and ask me to do a squash and merge. What exactly do I need to do in GitHub now?

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
The user is asking about how to handle a GitHub PR that Fernando has opened. Looking at the screenshots:

1. Fernando pushed changes to the repo
2. Vercel's auto-deploy is failing because "Git author fernandopps must have access to the project on Vercel to create deployments"
3. Fernando opened PR #1 to merge from `feat/NO-TICKET-add-buckets` into `main`
4. The PR shows "Squash and merge" as an option
5. Fernando asked the user to do a "squash and merge"

The workaround here is: When YOU (the repo owner who has Vercel access) do the squash and merge, the resulting commit will be authored by you (or have you as the committer), which should allow Vercel to deploy it successfully.

This is a straightforward question about GitHub workflow - no skills needed here. The user just needs to:

1. Go to the PR page: https://github.com/abhinavbhat-trilogy/Alpha-Experience-Chunks/pull/1
2. Click the "Squash and merge" button (it's already showing in the dropdown)
3. Confirm the merge

When you squash and merge, GitHub will create a new commit on main with you as the committer. Since you have access to Vercel, this should trigger a successful deployment.

Based on the screenshots, here's what you need to do:

**Steps to complete the squash and merge:**

1. Go to the PR that Fernando opened: `https://github.com/abhinavbhat-trilogy/Alpha-Experience-Chunks/pull/1`

2. You'll see the **"Squash and merge"** button at the bottom of the PR (it's already selected in the dropdown as shown in your screenshot)

3. Click **"Squash and merge"**

4. You'll get a dialog to edit the commit message - you can keep the default or customize it

5. Click **"Confirm squash and merge"**

**Why this works:**

When *you* perform the squash and merge (instead of Fernando), the resulting commit on `main` will have you as the committer. Since you have access to the Vercel project, the deployment will trigger successfully.

The Vercel check is failing because Fernando isn't added to your Vercel team - but that doesn't matter once you merge it, since the deployment on `main` will be attributed to you.
